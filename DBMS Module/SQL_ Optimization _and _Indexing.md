## Indexing  
Indexing is a mechanism that improves the speed of data retrieval operations in a database. It acts as a reference, similar to an index in a book, allowing users to locate information quickly without scanning the entire dataset.  

### Key Features of Indexing  

#### **Advantages (Pros):**  
1. **Fast Performance**:  
   - Speeds up query execution, especially for large datasets.  
2. **Efficient Sorting**:  
   - Indexes help in sorting data efficiently.  

#### **Disadvantages (Cons):**  
1. **Increased Storage**:  
   - Indexes consume additional disk space.  
2. **Maintenance Overhead**:  
   - Updating, inserting, or deleting data requires updating the index, which slows down write operations.

### Creating an Index  

Indexes are created using the `CREATE INDEX` statement.  

**Syntax**:  
```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);
```

**Example**:  
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders (order_date);
```
**Best Practice**: Follow naming conventions by prefixing index names with `idx_`.  

---

### Listing Existing Indexes  

To view all indexes on a table, use the `SHOW INDEX` command:  
```sql
SHOW INDEX FROM table_name;
```

---

### Dropping an Index  

Indexes can be removed using the `DROP INDEX` command:  
```sql
DROP INDEX idx_order_date ON orders;
```

**Important Note**:  
Excessive indexing can slow down write operations and increase storage utilization. Avoid creating unnecessary indexes.

## Types of Index  

**Duration**: 25 minutes  

Different types of indexes are used based on the specific requirements of the query.  

### 1. **Primary Key Index (Clustered Index)**  
- A **clustered index** is automatically created on the primary key column of a table.  
- Rows in the table are physically ordered based on the primary key.  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- Each table can have only one clustered index.  
- Significantly speeds up queries that search by the primary key.  

**Example**: Query without indexing vs. with indexing.  

- **Without Indexing**: SQL scans all rows sequentially to find the required record.  
- **With Indexing**: SQL directly accesses the required record using the sorted structure.

### 2. **Unique Index**  
- Ensures that values in the indexed column are unique.  
- Prevents duplicate entries.  

**Syntax**:  
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email ON instructor (email);
```

---

### 3. **Single Column Index (Non-Unique)**  
- Speeds up searches on a specific column.  
- Allows duplicate values.  

---

### 4. **Full-Text Index**  
- Used for advanced text searches within large text fields.  
- Useful for searching specific words or phrases in large text columns.  

**Example**: Searching for the word "epic" in the `description` column of a table:  
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM film 
WHERE MATCH(description) AGAINST ('epic' IN NATURAL LANGUAGE MODE);
```

---

## B-Tree  

A **B-Tree (Balanced Tree)** is a self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data. It is commonly used as the underlying structure for most SQL indexes.  

### Key Features:  
1. **Efficient Query Types**:  
   - **Range Queries**: Queries using operators like `<`, `>`, and `BETWEEN`.  
   - **Equality Queries**: Queries using `=` or specific values.  
   - **Ordered Queries**: Queries with `ORDER BY`.  

2. **Fast Data Access**:  
   - Enables logarithmic search time for indexed queries.  

**Diagram**:

## Hash Indexes  

**Duration**: 10 minutes  

A **Hash Index** uses a hash function to convert a search key into a specific memory location in a hash table.  

### Use Cases:  
1. **Exact Matches**:  
   - Ideal for queries using `=` or `IN`.  

2. **Limitations**:  
   - Not suitable for range queries (e.g., `<`, `>`, `BETWEEN`).  

**Example**:  
For exact matches, a hash index provides faster access compared to a B-Tree index.

## Key Optimization Commands  

**Duration**: 10 minutes  

### 1. **ANALYZE**  

The `ANALYZE TABLE` command collects statistics about a table's content, helping the query optimizer make better decisions.  

**Syntax**:  
```sql
ANALYZE TABLE table_name;
```

---

### 2. **OPTIMIZE**  

The `OPTIMIZE TABLE` command reorganizes the physical storage of data, reducing fragmentation and improving query performance.  

**Syntax**:  
```sql
OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name;
```

**Diagram**:

## Practical Examples and Best Practices  

**Message for Instructor**:  
- Demonstrate creating an index and querying with and without it to show performance improvements.  
- Highlight the impact of excessive indexing on write operations.

## Common SQL Optimization Interview Questions  

1. **How do you identify slow queries in a database?**  
   - Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze the query execution plan.  
   - Check for full table scans and optimize accordingly.  

2. **How to check if indexes are present for a query?**  
   - Use `SHOW INDEX FROM table_name` or `EXPLAIN` query.  

3. **How to avoid redundant data retrieval?**  
   - Use proper joins, filter unnecessary columns, and avoid `SELECT *`.  

4. **How to use aliases effectively in SQL queries?**  
   - Simplify table or column names using aliases for better readability and reduced ambiguity.  

5. **How to maintain optimized queries over time?**  
   - Regularly analyze tables with `ANALYZE TABLE`.  
   - Reorganize data storage with `OPTIMIZE TABLE`.  
   - Update indexes as data evolves.

2. **Types of Indexes**:  
   - Primary Key (Clustered), Unique, Single Column, and Full-Text Indexes.  
3. **B-Tree**: Supports range, equality, and ordered queries efficiently.
